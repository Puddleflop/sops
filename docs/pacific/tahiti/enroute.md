## Airspace

TAH covers all airspace within 200 NM of the `TAF VOR` below `FL195`, excluding the TAHITI TMA 1 and 2 (Class D) below `FL195` where a radar service is provided by A-TAH.

TAH provides a radar enroute/approach service within the ILES SOUS LEVNT TMA (Class D) above `A015`. Otherwise TAH provides a procedural service above `FL045` (Class E). 

When A-TAH is offline TAH automatically inherits and assumes all responsibility for that sector.
