## Control Positions and Navaids

| Position Name  | Shortcode  | Callsign        | Frequency   | Login ID       | Usage      |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------------| ---------- |

## Airspace

The Invercargill CTR/D follows the inner lateral boundries shown below from `SFC` to `A015`. The CTR/D is comprised of three sectors - North, South and Instrument. The Invercargill CTA/D follows the outer lateral boundary as shown below. Within 15 nm `NV` VOR the lower limit is `A015`, to the south the lower limit is `A025` except to the south east where it is `A045`, to the north it steps between `A035`, `A055`, and `A065`, and to the east it is `A035`. The upper limit is `A095` for the entire CTA as seen in the diagram below.

## Areas of Responsibility

Invercargill's main apron has five stands. The areas of responsibility are as depicted below.

## Pushback and Taxi

Pushback and startup clearance from stand one to five is managed by Tower. Controllers can make use of a "tail-facing" instruction to manage direction of pushback. 

An aircraft may be given a combined taxi/backtrack instruction, Traffic permitting. Aircraft may advise the controller they are able to accept an intersection departure, therefore they may be taxiied to the holding point, omiting the backtrack instruction.

!!! example "Taxi Backtrack Instruction"
    **ANZ758M**: *"ANZ758M, request taxi."*

    **Invercargill Tower**: *"ANZ758M, taxi backtrack, lineup runway 22."*

!!! example "Taxi Instruction"
    **ZK-ELT**: *"ELT, request taxi."*

    **Invercargill Tower**: *"ELT, via `A`, enter backtrack, lineup runway 22."*

## Departures
IFR traffic departing via `ADLUP` shall be handed off to STH either crossing `KELSO` or passing `A095`. Other IFR departures shall be handed off to the appropriate sector either crossing the lateral boundary of the airspace or passing the upper limit of `A095` - whichever comes first.

### SID Assignment

The controller shall assign the SID that is suggested by their Controller Client noting the steep climb gradient to `FL150` required by SIDs via `ANOPA` .

### STAR Clearances 

TNV is responsible for issuing STAR clearances for aircraft bound for Dunedin and Queenstown. With coordination to TDN and QTMA on the appropriate STARs.

## Arrivals
STH shall issue STARs to arrivals without coordination with Invercargill Tower. Invercargill Tower may choose to coordinate with STH or amend the arrival on first contact.

### Runway 22
All RNAV arrivals terminate at either `LALEV` or `DOTLU`, which are the IAF for the RNP approach. Aircraft for the VOR approach will track direct to the `NV` VOR. Aircraft for the VOR DME approach will either track to the `NV` VOR, direct to `PEBLY`, or join the 10 `NV` DME Arc depending on the aircraft's position.

### Missed Approach
In the event of a missed approach, aicraft should be instructed to carry out the published missed approach procedure. Aircraft on the RNP approach will track straight out to `AMVIX` holding at `A030`. The aircraft can then be issued the approprite arrival procedure from `AMVIX` to commence the approach again. VOR aircraft will track to the `NV` VOR holding at `A020`. The aircraft can then be recleared for the approach from `NV` VOR. VOR DME aircraft will track to `ROCKS` holding at `A030`. The aircraft can then be cleared direct to the `NV` VOR to commence the approach again.

### Runway 04
All RNAV arrivals terminate at `ESNUP` or `EGAMU`, which is the IAF for the RNP approach. Aircraft for the VOR approach will track direct to the `NV` VOR. Aircraft for the VOR DME approach will either track to the `NV` VOR, direct to `PEBLY`, or join the `NV` 10 DME Arc depending on the aircraft's position.

### Missed Approach
In the event of a missed approach, aicraft should be instructed to carry out the published missed approach procedure. Aircraft on the RNP approach will track straight out to `AMVIX` holding at `A030`.  The aircraft can then be issued the approprite arrival procedure from `AMVIX` to commence the approach again. Aircraft on the VOR or VOR DME approaches will track to the `NV` VOR holding at `A020`. The aircraft can then be recleared for the approach from `NV` VOR.

## VFR Procedures
NZNV has no published VFR procedures. VFR traffic shall be issued plain language instructions.

## Ryans Creek Uncontrolled IFR
Ryans Creek (NZRC) is a small uncontrolled GA aerodrome 30 nm south of Invercargill.

### Departures

IFR aircraft on the ground at RC shall call TNV prior to taxi to obtain IFR clearance. After a correct readback aircraft shall cleared to enter controlled airspace via `SEBSA 1` departure shall. Aircraft are then advised to report prior to entering controlled airspace. 

### Arrivals

TNV shall clear the aircraft to leave controlled airspace via the RNAV approach for runway 22. The aircraft shall be instsructed to report on the ground to cancel their IFR flight plan.
