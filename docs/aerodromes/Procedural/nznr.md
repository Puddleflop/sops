## Positions

| Position Name | Shortcode | Callsign     | Frequency | Login ID | Usage   |

## Airspace

The Napier CTR/D follows the inner lateral boundries shown below from `SFC` to `A025`. The CTR/D is comprised of one sector. 

The wider Napier CTA/D follows the outer boundaries as shown below, with the vertical boundaries also listed in their respective sector. Napier's airspace tops out at `A095`.

Napier Tower provides a Procedural Approach service for the wider CTA/D and an uncontrolled service into Hastings (NZHS).

## Areas of Responsibility

Napier's main apron has seven stands. The areas of responsibility are as depicted below.

## Pushback and Taxi

Pushback and startup clearance from stand one to five is managed by Tower. Controllers can make use of a "tail-facing" instruction to manage direction of pushback. 

An aircraft may be given a combined taxi/backtrack instruction, traffic permitting. Aircraft may advise the controller they are able to accept an intersection departure, therefore they may be taxiied to the holding point, omiting the backtrack instruction.

!!! example "Taxi Backtrack Instruction"
    **ANZ758M**: *"ANZ758M, request taxi."*

    **Invercargill Tower**: *"ANZ758M, taxi backtrack, lineup runway 34."*

!!! example "Taxi Instruction"
    **ZK-ELT**: *"ELT, request taxi."*

    **Invercargill Tower**: *"ELT, via `C`, lineup runway 34, cross grass 34."*

## Departures

IFR traffic departing via `ADLUP` shall be handed off to STH either crossing `KELSO` or passing `A095`. Other IFR departures shall be handed off to the appropriate sector either crossing the lateral boundary of the airspace or passing the upper limit of `A095` - whichever comes first.

### SID Assignment

The controller shall assign the SID that is suggested by their Controller Client noting the higher climb gradient on the `TUKNE #R` to `A030`.

### STAR Clearances 

Tower is not responsible for issuing STAR clearances for any outbound aircraft.

## Arrivals

BAY and OHA shall issue STARs to arrivals without coordination with Napier Tower. Napier Tower may choose to coordinate with the adjacent sectors or amend the arrival on first contact.

### Runway 16

All RNP arrivals terminate at `REMEV` or `RISBU`, which is the IAF for the RNP approach. Aircraft for the VOR DME approach will either track to the `NR` VOR, for the `NAPIER #F` arrival to join the `NV` 10 DME Arc, or conduct the procedure turn, depending on the aircraft's position.

The prefered order of approaches are RNP RWY 16, VOR DME Y RWY 16 or VOR DME Z RWY 16 depending on aircraft category.

### Runway 34

All RNP arrivals terminate at either `EPGUM` or `VETAB`, which are the IAF for the RNP approach. Aircraft for the VOR approach will track direct to the `NR` VOR. Aircraft for the VOR DME approach will either track to the `NR` VOR, for the `NAPIER #E` arrival to join the `NV` 10 DME Arc, or conduct the procedure turn, depending on the aircraft's position.

The prefered order of approaches are RNP RWY 34, VOR DME RWY 34, VOR RWY 34.

## VFR Procedures

NZNR has both published VFR arrival and departure procedures.

### Arrivals

In order to lessen the amount of instructions given to VFR traffic, the Controller shall issue a published VFR arrival where possible. Once the Pilot reports overhead the respective VRP, Napier Tower shall issue circuit joining instructions. [Refer to AIP chart for VFR arrivals](https://www.aip.net.nz/assets/AIP/Aerodrome-Charts/Napier-NZNR/NZNR_35.1_35.2.pdf){ target=new }.

### Departures

In order to lessen the amount of instructions given to VFR traffic, the Controller shall issue one of the VFR Departure Procedures where possible, otherwise a more plain language clearance may be issued. [Refer to AIP chart for VFR departures](https://www.aip.net.nz/assets/AIP/Aerodrome-Charts/Napier-NZNR/NZNR_64.1_64.2.pdf){ target=new }.

## Coordination

### OHA

Tower is normally not required to advise OHA of any departing IFR traffic, and may conduct a silent handover when aircraft crosses the common boundary, or when approaching the top of Tower's CTA. Except where previously coordinated, IFR aircraft shall cross the common airspace boundary overhead an IFR waypoint, or established on an airway.

All VFR traffic handovers shall be coordinated with OHA. 

### BAY

Tower is normally not required to advise BAY of any departing IFR traffic, and may conduct a silent handover when aircraft crosses the common boundary. Except where previously coordinated, IFR aircraft shall cross the common airspace boundary overhead an IFR waypoint, or established on an airway.

All VFR traffic handovers shall be coordinated with BAY. 

## Hastings Uncontrolled IFR

Hastings (NZHS) is a small uncontrolled GA aerodrome 11.8 NM south of Napier.

### Departures

IFR aircraft on the ground at HS shall call TNR prior to taxi to obtain IFR clearance. After a correct readback aircraft enroute to the `NR` VOR shall be cleared to enter controlled airspace via either the `VICTOR #` or `WHISKEY #` departures. Aircraft on other routings shall be cleared to enter controlled airspace as appropriate. Aircraft are then advised to report prior to entering controlled airspace. 

### Arrivals

Only the RNP RWY 01 approach commences within controlled airpace.

#### RWY 01

TNR shall clear the aircraft to leave controlled airspace via the RNP approach for runway 01. The aircraft shall be instsructed to report on the ground to cancel their IFR flight plan.

#### RWY 19

TNR shall clear the aircraft to leave controlled airspace on descent. The aircraft shall be instsructed to report on the ground to cancel their IFR flight plan.
